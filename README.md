# Resources

Following [quarto publishing tutorial](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command)

For more advanced features [this discussion topic](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/discussions/7776) provides a link to their first commit which provides what looks like the necessary bread crumbs for me to duplicate some of the elements of their Pages that I like. It is based on the [book structure](https://quarto.org/docs/books/book-structure.html) which I preferred to the website structure.

Additional resources I found helpful: <br>
[TOC, section numbering, external links](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#external-links) <br>
[Themes](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html) <br>
[Figure options within RStudio/quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/computations/rstudio.html#figures)
